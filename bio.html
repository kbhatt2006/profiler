      <h2>Who is Elon Musk ?</h2>
      <p>Elon Reeve Musk (/ˈiːlɒn ˈmʌsk/; born June 28, 1971) is a South Africa-born, Canadian-American entrepreneur, inventor, engineer and investor. He is the CEO and CTO of SpaceX, CEO and chief product architect of Tesla Motors, and chairman of SolarCity. He is the founder of SpaceX and a cofounder of PayPal,Tesla Motors, and Zip2.He has also envisioned a conceptual high-speed transportation system known as the Hyperloop.</p>
      <h2> Early Life</h2>
      <p>Musk was born June 28, 1971, in Pretoria, South Africa,to a Canadian-English mother and prominent model Maye Musk and a South African-born British father and electrical/mechanical engineer Errol Musk. After his parents divorced in 1980, Musk lived mostly with his father in locations in South Africa. He taught himself computer programming and at age 12 sold the computer code for a video game called Blastar for $500.

      Musk attended Waterkloof House Preparatory School before graduating from Pretoria Boys High School and moving to Canada in 1988 at age 17, after obtaining Canadian citizenship through his mother. He did so before his South African military service, reasoning that it would be easier to emigrate to the United States from Canada than from South Africa.

      At age 19, Musk was accepted into Queen's University in Kingston, Ontario for undergraduate study, and in 1992, after spending two years at Queen's University, Musk transferred to the University of Pennsylvania where he eventually received a Bachelor of Science degree in Physics from the Wharton School. Musk stayed on a year to finish his second bachelor's degree, a Bachelor of Arts degree in Economics. In 1995, aged 24, Musk moved to California to begin a PhD in Applied physics at Stanford, but left the program after two days to pursue his entrepreneurial aspirations in the areas of the Internet, renewable energy and outer space. In 2002, he became an American citizen.</p>

      <h2>Personal Life</h2>
      <p>Musk has been married twice. He met his first wife, the Canadian author Justine Musk (née Wilson), while both were students at Ontario's Queen's University, Kingston. They married in 2000 and separated eight years later, after having six sons, five of whom they share custody.Their first son, Nevada Alexander, died of SIDS when he was 10 weeks old. Following the divorce, Justine Musk gave an interview describing her marriage with Musk in Marie Claire magazine. Musk announced in January 2012 that he had recently ended a four-year relationship with his second wife, British actress Talulah Riley.

      On January 18, 2012, he tweeted to Riley, "It was an amazing four years. I will love you forever. You will make someone very happy one day."However, on February 11, 2014, Musk was invited to attend a state dinner at the White House, and the guest list included Mr. Elon Musk and Mrs. Talulah Musk. In a 60 Minutes interview on March 30, 2014, with CBS journalist Scott Pelley, Elon and Talulah are shown to still be together with Elon's five children from his first marriage.In July 2013 he had remarried his second wife. In December 2014 he filed for a second divorce from her.</p>
